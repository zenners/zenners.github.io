description: A real-time chatroom application built on Ionic, Angular and Firebase. As a user, you'll be able to enter a chatroom talk with other users.
thoughts: This is my first time using firebase and I'm quite impressed with the ease its ease of use and functionality when it comes to Authentication. It saves a lot of time with syncing and broadcasting data. I would've had to write all the emits and the change listeners, but Firebase does a lot of the socket lifting :) Ionic is a pleasure to work with and I'm finally comfortable with the Angular flow.
challenges: The schema that I have is pretty simple. I started looking into better ways of schema design ie flattening. This is definitely something I'll pay attention more as I make more complicated apps.
roadmap: <li> Chatting with friends instead of simply joining a chat room</li><li>Better CSS</li><li>Facebook Auth</li> <li>Deploying to AppStore and PlayStore</li>
